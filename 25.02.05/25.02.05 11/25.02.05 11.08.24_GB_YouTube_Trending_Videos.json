            "description": "Civilization 7 is almost here and the developers decided to give me access for the last few weeks to help them find interesting bugs, glitches and exploits with the game. Low and behold the game is full of them and I have been doing my best to package them up into fun and silly videos. This today is my scientific discovery to see if I can take a sword wielding roman legion and make them more powerful than a modern age tank. The tank has a combat strength of 65 which is incredibly high in comparison to the romans 25. A tank can easily 1 hit a roman because well its a tank. However today I will be cheesing some of the silly game design to create a roman super soldier program that cannot be stopped. My Units will become immortal super soldiers that can somehow defeat aircraft carrier boats. \n\nSo what is Sid Meiers civilization 7: Civilization VII, as a 4X turn-based strategy game, has the player oversee the growth of a human civilization from early settlements to an advanced culture. The player uses various units, representing military and civilian units, to explore the map, grow their civilization through additional cities, culture, and technology, gather resources from the geography around their settlements, and defeat threats from foreign civilizations also attempting to grow. The player can win the game through a range of possible victory conditions, ranging from peaceful solutions to full military domination of the world.\n\nThis is NOT sponsored but if you do want to grab the game here is a steam link.

The tank has a combat strength of 65 which is incredibly high in comparison to the romans 25. A tank can easily 1 hit a roman because well its a tank.

Throughout this we'll be talking about the main comics that inspired it along with what stories we've heard theyre adapting.\n\nIt's february 4th which is an F and a 4 and though there's been trailers shown privately at events, this adds a lot in. That was put together really quickly and was mainly made up from costume tests, special effects reels and what theyd managed to film so far.\n\nHowever we will also be going over what happened in that one if you havent seen it and this is kind of our mega breakdown about everything you need to know.\n\nSo come with us as we explain first steps first look and lets get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with an hour long countdown which I rushed home for and the wife wasn't happy BUT after that we get into the trailer.\n\nAnd by that I mean another live event.\n\nBUT AFTER THAT we get into the trailer.\n\nBeginning with a tour of the baxter building we watch Reed and Sue guiding someone about the house.\n\nIts very akin to the hickman run in which theyd often give tours. This too featured in Civil War and its pretty much just the family showing the world who they are.\n\nTheyre pretty much celebrities so its kind of like a 1960s reality tv thing. Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio it also feels like a classic tv show.\n\nNow the films obviously gonna have a very heavy 60s retro futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe movies gonna be set in 1963 but I do feel like theyll be pulled into the modern day...or maybe across the multiverse.\n\nHowever, If youve read the original run of the comics it all feels really inline with that. Its kind of like a Jetsons thing set in the past where they have really high tech things but also a sixties style to it.",

Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio it also feels like a classic tv show.\n\nNow the films obviously gonna have a very heavy 60s retro futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe movies gonna be set in 1963 but I do feel like theyll be pulled into the modern day...or maybe across the multiverse.\n\nHowever, If youve read the original run of the comics it all feels really inline with that. Its kind of like a Jetsons thing set in the past where they have really high tech things but also a sixties style to it."

Go to https://www.RocketMoney.com/sarian to get started for free!\n\n__________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday! \n\nJoan Little, a young Black woman, made headlines in the 1970s. That's because...\n\n... alone in her cold, dark jail cell... she faced an unthinkable choice: submit to her attacker or fight for her life. And what happened next led to a trial that had America in a complete chokehold and changed legal history forever.\n\nWhat led to that fateful night in a small-town North Carolina jail? Did Joan go too far? And how did her trial spark a nationwide uproar over race, gender, and the fight for self-defense rights?\n\nThis is the groundbreaking story of Joan Little.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon.\nxo \nBailey Sarian\n\nI sometimes talk about my Good Reads in the show.

            "title": "Cruz vs Fierro HIGHLIGHTS: February 1, 2025 | PBC on Prime Video",
            "description": "Former world champion Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (27-3-1, 18 KOs) edges out all-action contender Angel Fierro (23-3-2, 18 KOs) via unanimous decision (98-92, 97-93, 96-94) after 10 rounds of super lightweight action in an instant 2025 Fight of the Year contender that saw the fighters combine to throw 1,410 punches.\n \n\"I came here to fight and show the world the best of what I can do and I think I did that,” said Cruz. “I entertained the crowd and gave them a show. I'm so happy that I gave the fans a great fight with a lot of pressure like I always do and I'm proud to do it with my family here watching.”\n \n\"I came here to give the fans a great fight and leave it all in the ring,” said Fierro. “I don't care about the judges, I care about the fans. But I do hope that 'Pitbull' gives me a rematch, because I think I deserve it.”\n \nCruz and Fierro lived up to their promise to give the fans an “all-out Mexican war” as they went toe-to-toe from the opening bell, throwing powerful shots right from the outset. Mexico City’s Cruz set the tone with a huge first round, landing over 50% of his shots, including a career-best 39 power shots.\n \nTijuana’s Fierro struck back in round three, landing a powerful right hook to the temple that knocked Cruz off balance and grabbed his attention, eventually leading to a wild final minute of the round that saw both fighters land huge blows. With the back-and-forth nature of the fight set early, both continued to fight in close range until the final bell.\n \nFierro was able to keep up his impressive activity throughout the fight, throwing 786 punches to Cruz’s 624, while Cruz out landed Fierro 248 to 238. True to form, the two combatants spent the final two rounds in a pitched toe-to-toe battle that ended with the crowd on its feet in appreciation for what they had witnessed.\n \n\"I trained for eight weeks and worked really hard to leave everything in the ring,” said Fierro. “My name will stand forever, because Angel Fierro did his thing tonight. I went into the ring with determination and I fought with my heart. We showed everything that Mexican boxing is all about tonight.\"\n \n\"Fierro deserves all the respect in the world and I take my hat off to him,” said Cruz. “Thank you to all the fans who came to support me, because that's who I fight for.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz  #CruzFierro #AngelFierro \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

                "description": "Former world champion Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (27-3-1, 18 KOs) edges out all-action contender Angel Fierro (23-3-2, 18 KOs) via unanimous decision (98-92, 97-93, 96-94) after 10 rounds of super lightweight action in an instant 2025 Fight of the Year contender that saw the fighters combine to throw 1,410 punches.\n \n\"I came here to fight and show the world the best of what I can do and I think I did that,” said Cruz. “I entertained the crowd and gave them a show. I'm so happy that I gave the fans a great fight with a lot of pressure like I always do and I'm proud to do it with my family here watching.”\n \n\"I came here to give the fans a great fight and leave it all in the ring,” said Fierro. “I don't care about the judges, I care about the fans. But I do hope that 'Pitbull' gives me a rematch, because I think I deserve it.”\n \nCruz and Fierro lived up to their promise to give the fans an “all-out Mexican war” as they went toe-to-toe from the opening bell, throwing powerful shots right from the outset. Mexico City’s Cruz set the tone with a huge first round, landing over 50% of his shots, including a career-best 39 power shots.\n \nTijuana’s Fierro struck back in round three, landing a powerful right hook to the temple that knocked Cruz off balance and grabbed his attention, eventually leading to a wild final minute of the round that saw both fighters land huge blows. With the back-and-forth nature of the fight set early, both continued to fight in close range until the final bell.\n \nFierro was able to keep up his impressive activity throughout the fight, throwing 786 punches to Cruz’s 624, while Cruz out landed Fierro 248 to 238. True to form, the two combatants spent the final two rounds in a pitched toe-to-toe battle that ended with the crowd on its feet in appreciation for what they had witnessed.\n \n\"I trained for eight weeks and worked really hard to leave everything in the ring,” said Fierro. “My name will stand forever, because Angel Fierro did his thing tonight. I went into the ring with determination and I fought with my heart. We showed everything that Mexican boxing is all about tonight.\"\n \n\"Fierro deserves all the respect in the world and I take my hat off to him,” said Cruz. “Thank you to all the fans who came to support me, because that's who I fight for.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz  #CruzFierro #AngelFierro \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

            "description": "After the White House confirmed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would go into affect on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced incoming counter tariffs against the U.S.\n \n“Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the U.S. trade action with 25 per cent tariffs against a $155 billion worth of American goods,” Trudeau said in an address to the nation Saturday evening.\n\nTrudeau said this will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days’ time to “allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.”\n\nThis comes after weeks of Trump repeatedly warning Mexico and Canada — two of the United States’ top trading partners — he will impose tariffs if the two countries do not end fentanyl trafficking and the flow of migrants across U.S. border.\n \nSince the initial threat, Trudeau has held several meetings with Canada’s premiers, working through plans to bolster their respective border security efforts.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10992959/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-feb-1/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #Tariffs #JustinTrudeau #Trump",

                "description": "After the White House confirmed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would go into affect on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced incoming counter tariffs against the U.S.\n \n“Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the U.S. trade action with 25 per cent tariffs against a $155 billion worth of American goods,” Trudeau said in an address to the nation Saturday evening.\n\nTrudeau said this will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days’ time to “allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.”\n\nThis comes after weeks of Trump repeatedly warning Mexico and Canada — two of the United States’ top trading partners — he will impose tariffs if the two countries do not end fentanyl trafficking and the flow of migrants across U.S. border.\n \nSince the initial threat, Trudeau has held several meetings with Canada’s premiers, working through plans to bolster their respective border security efforts.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10992959/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-feb-1/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #Tariffs #JustinTrudeau #Trump"

            "description": "Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre reacted on Sunday to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump's executive order was signed on Saturday and the tariffs take effect Tuesday.\n \nPoilievre condemned President Trump's \"massive and unjustified tariffs, which will damage both American and Canadian economies.\" He's calling for an immediate tax cut to put Canada first.\n \nHe also posed a question to Americans: \"A 25 per cent tariff on Canada and only a 10 per cent tariff on China?

            "description": "Elle Mannion | January 31, 2025\nIf you want it, Faye Webster’s Tiny Desk can offer an escape. Featuring her longtime band and a string quartet, Webster guides us through a swooning and sweeping set culled from her quickly growing catalog. \n\nWebster’s Underdressed at the Symphony was inspired by just that: Buying last-minute tickets to the symphony orchestra in her hometown of Atlanta and finding the experience otherworldly. She performs “But Not Kiss” and the title track from that album. Webster is a gentle but captivating performer in this space, at times grooving with her locked-in band. But she also appears to be in a trance of her own, like on the Atlanta Millionaires Club cuts “Jonny” and its spoken-word reprise. The horns heard on those original recordings gave everything a brassy warmth, but here Trey Pollard’s string arrangements enhance this Tiny Desk’s dream-like quality. \n\nSET LIST\n“In A Good Way”\n“But Not Kiss”\n“Underdressed at the Symphony”\n“Jonny”\n“Jonny (Reprise)”\n\nMUSICIANS\nFaye Webster: vocals, guitar\nNoor Khan: bass, backing vocals\nMatthew Stoessel: guitar, pedal steel \nNick Rosen: piano\nCharles Garner: drums, percussion\nEllen Riccio: violin \nDanielle Wiebe Burke: viola \nStephanie Barrett: cello \nAnnie Leeth: violin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Elle Mannion\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #fayewebster",

                "description": "Elle Mannion | January 31, 2025\nIf you want it, Faye Webster’s Tiny Desk can offer an escape. Featuring her longtime band and a string quartet, Webster guides us through a swooning and sweeping set culled from her quickly growing catalog. \n\nWebster’s Underdressed at the Symphony was inspired by just that: Buying last-minute tickets to the symphony orchestra in her hometown of Atlanta and finding the experience otherworldly. She performs “But Not Kiss” and the title track from that album. Webster is a gentle but captivating performer in this space, at times grooving with her locked-in band. But she also appears to be in a trance of her own, like on the Atlanta Millionaires Club cuts “Jonny” and its spoken-word reprise. The horns heard on those original recordings gave everything a brassy warmth, but here Trey Pollard’s string arrangements enhance this Tiny Desk’s dream-like quality. \n\nSET LIST\n“In A Good Way”\n“But Not Kiss”\n“Underdressed at the Symphony”\n“Jonny”\n“Jonny (Reprise)”\n\nMUSICIANS\nFaye Webster: vocals, guitar\nNoor Khan: bass, backing vocals\nMatthew Stoessel: guitar, pedal steel \nNick Rosen: piano\nCharles Garner: drums, percussion\nEllen Riccio: violin \nDanielle Wiebe Burke: viola \nStephanie Barrett: cello \nAnnie Leeth: violin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Elle Mannion\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #fayewebster"

When AI is used to generate any imagery that may appear onscreen, we'll add this to the video description. We're learning as we go about AI usage and transparency, and appreciate your thoughts.\n\nAbout: \nJohnny Harris is an Emmy-winning independent journalist and contributor to the New York Times.

Jordan comes a new vision of fear: “Sinners.” \n\nTrying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers (Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.\n\n“You keep dancing with the devil, one day he’s gonna follow you home.”\n\nWritten and directed by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Coogler, “Sinners” stars Jordan in a dual role, joined by Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O’Connell, Wunmi Mosaku , Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, Miles Caton, and Delroy Lindo. \n\nThe film is produced by Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler. The executive producers are Ludwig Göransson, Will Greenfield and Rebecca Cho. \n\nCoogler’s behind-the-camera artisans include his “Black Panther” franchise collaborators: director of photography Autumn Durald Arkapaw, Oscar-winning production designer Hannah Beachler, editor Michael P. Shawver, Oscar-winning composer Ludwig Göransson, and Oscar-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter.   \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents A Proximity Media Production: “Sinners.” The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

            "description": "I've finally completed my dream Tropical Wetlands Vivarium! After months of planning, tank construction, and hardscaping, it was time to add in our vast collection of terrestrial and aquatic plants. From Bromeliads to Bucephilandras, mosses to vines, Korean ferns to java ferns, the collection of plants in this paludarium aquascape was a total dream. It required me and my team to apply principles of aquascape, as pioneered by the godfather of modern aquascaping, the late Takashi Amano.

                "description": "Ho creato un gigantesco vivarium tropicale di zone umide, il mio terzo gigantesco vivarium ecosistemico! Dopo mesi di pianificazione, costruzione dell'acquario e sistemazione della vasca con legni e rocce, era giunto il momento di piantare le nostre piante acquatiche e terrestri. Dai muschi alle viti, dalle felci coreane alle felci di Giava, la collezione di piante in questo acquascape era strabiliante. Quando il vivarium fu completato, la vasca era pronta per GAIA 3, l'aggiunta di animali delle zone umide per completare finalmente il nostro ecosistema delle zone umide. Spero che vi piaccia questa Stagione 4, Episodio 3 della mia serie Ecosystem Vivarium. Amore per le formiche per sempre!
