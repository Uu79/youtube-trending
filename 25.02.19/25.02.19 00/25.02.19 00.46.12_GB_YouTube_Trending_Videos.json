            "description": "A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto’s Pearson Airport, but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries, the airport’s chief executive said.\r\n\r\nSnow was being blown by winds gusting to 40 mph (65 kph) when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it's not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down.\r\n\r\nCanadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media only showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned, the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac.\r\n\r\n“We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,” Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/delta-flight-toronto-airport-incident/507-81c8b0f2-16fa-4371-9ef5-2d9933d96952 --\n\nAt 3News, we’re not here to tell you the news, we’re here to share the stories that you say matter most to you.

I'm a Minecraft channel though, so of course we had to make it unique.\n\nWe coded a mod that makes it so you can scan things from real life into Minecraft. Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)",

This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: ItzRealMe @Leowook @jumperwho @Nufuli @Derapchu @DylPicklee@Reeon @mixiku_ @naparizel @Hexatope \n\nThis is Episode 1 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nSand Grid Prison built by: @Wato-1876 \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe / Unstable SMP: a staged Minecraft server created by Parrot, Wemmbu, and Spoke to tell stories in Minecraft. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

                "description": "ItzRealMe is undisputedly the #1 ranked Minecraft player in the entire world. And he wants me dead... This is How I Got Hunted by the World's Best Minecraft Player. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable Universe series where he broke into Minecraft's Most Secure Prisons or got Hunted by Minecraft's Deadliest Players. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: ItzRealMe @Leowook @jumperwho @Nufuli @Derapchu @DylPicklee@Reeon @mixiku_ @naparizel @Hexatope \n\nThis is Episode 1 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nSand Grid Prison built by: @Wato-1876 \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe / Unstable SMP: a staged Minecraft server created by Parrot, Wemmbu, and Spoke to tell stories in Minecraft. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!"

            "description": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books. The Philadelphia Eagles are world champions. And Philly didn't just win vs the Kansas City Chiefs, it was unlike anything we've seen in Super Bowl history for many different reasons.\n\nJalen Hurts put up one of the greatest performances football has seen. Between the adjustments made due to the Chiefs intentions to stop Saquon Barkley, utilizing skill positions like AJ Brown, Devonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Jahan Dotson, etc, Nick Sirianni and Kellen Moore did wonders against Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defense. And that includes the work from the offensive line in Lane Johnson, Mekhi Becton, and Jordan Mailata.\n\nThen in terms of the Eagles defense, you could argue this was even more dominant of a showing. Josh Sweat, Jalen Carter, Milton Williams, Nolan Smith, Zack Baun, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, you name it, the entire unit of Vic Fangio's had one of the best games ever seen on the biggest stage. And ultimately, it was a victory we won't soon forget in the fashion it occurred.\n\nAlso, give me ideas for other NFL videos, news, and discussions I should cover in the future. I read ALL comments.\n\nThank you so much for the support guys.\n\nMY NBA CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/c/HoopsDigest\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thehoopsdigest\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@hoopsdigest?l...\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

                "description": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books. The Philadelphia Eagles are world champions. And Philly didn't just win vs the Kansas City Chiefs, it was unlike anything we've seen in Super Bowl history for many different reasons.\n\nJalen Hurts put up one of the greatest performances football has seen. Between the adjustments made due to the Chiefs intentions to stop Saquon Barkley, utilizing skill positions like AJ Brown, Devonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Jahan Dotson, etc, Nick Sirianni and Kellen Moore did wonders against Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defense. And that includes the work from the offensive line in Lane Johnson, Mekhi Becton, and Jordan Mailata.\n\nThen in terms of the Eagles defense, you could argue this was even more dominant of a showing. Josh Sweat, Jalen Carter, Milton Williams, Nolan Smith, Zack Baun, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, you name it, the entire unit of Vic Fangio's had one of the best games ever seen on the biggest stage. And ultimately, it was a victory we won't soon forget in the fashion it occurred.\n\nAlso, give me ideas for other NFL videos, news, and discussions I should cover in the future. I read ALL comments.\n\nThank you so much for the support guys.\n\nMY NBA CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/c/HoopsDigest\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thehoopsdigest\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@hoopsdigest?l...\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

            "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

                "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!"

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!\n—\n\n🎬 *CREDITS:*\nDIRECTOR/HOST » Sonny Side\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Trần Quang Đạo\nCAMERA OPERATOR » Đinh Tuấn Anh\nEPISODE EDITOR » Ngọc Lê Hồng\nCOLOR & MASTER » Quí Nguyễn\nON-GROUND PRODUCER » Terryh Nguyen\nCO-PRODUCER » Chantal Bieger\nCO-HOSTS » DaHong 大红 https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5e7fc5c600000000010034d6 | Bert https://www.instagram.com/foodxbert\n\nSelected tracks via Audio Network 🛆\n\n*Business Inquiries:*\n✉️ marketing@befrs.com"

            "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test!

In this video we get a shipment of steel coils then cut the steel so it can be pressed into the shapes for a drawer and for the tool box itself.

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"
