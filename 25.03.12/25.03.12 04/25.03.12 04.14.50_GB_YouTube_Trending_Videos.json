His firm is at a crisis point, and in order to survive, he must embrace a role he held in contempt his entire career. Ted is surrounded by a stellar group of characters who test their loyalties to both Ted and each other while they can’t help but mix their personal and professional lives. All of this is going on while we slowly unravel the events that years ago led Ted to leave behind everything and everyone he loved.\n\nThe series stars Stephen Amell, Lex Scott Davis, Josh McDermitt and Bryan Greenberg. Aaron Korsh is writer and executive producer. David Bartis, Doug Liman, Gene Klein, Anton Cropper, Genevieve Sparling, Rick Muirragui and Jon Cowan also executive produce. “Suits LA” is produced by UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group.\n\nHarvey Specter Is Back | Suits LA | NBC\nhttps://youtu.be/dh_LN1Nk5pc\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",

I take LMNT everywhere with me, especially on these long hikes.\n\nIn this video, I finally attempt a hike to the legendary crashed CIA plane in the middle of Death Valley. \n\nThis plane was part of a top secret program in the 1950s as part of the United State's Cold War efforts. The program was a joint program between the Air Force and the CIA. Unfortunately, on one cold night in January of 1952, one of these planes crashed on a training mission over Death Valley. \n\nDue to the remote and difficult nature of getting to the airplane, it was left there. Now, 73 years later, I hiked in to see what it was all about!\n\nI hope you enjoy!\n\nYou can follow my journey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nCerro Gordo T-Shirts and more: https://store.cerrogordomines.com/ \n\nMailing Address: PO Box 490, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nTHANK YOU!",

I take LMNT everywhere with me, especially on these long hikes.\n\nIn this video, I finally attempt a hike to the legendary crashed CIA plane in the middle of Death Valley. \n\nThis plane was part of a top secret program in the 1950s as part of the United State's Cold War efforts. The program was a joint program between the Air Force and the CIA. Unfortunately, on one cold night in January of 1952, one of these planes crashed on a training mission over Death Valley. \n\nDue to the remote and difficult nature of getting to the airplane, it was left there. Now, 73 years later, I hiked in to see what it was all about!\n\nI hope you enjoy!\n\nYou can follow my journey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nCerro Gordo T-Shirts and more: https://store.cerrogordomines.com/ \n\nMailing Address: PO Box 490, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nTHANK YOU!"

Go to http://DrinkLMNT.com/eamonandbec for a free sample pack with any purchase!\n\nAfter living in a converted sprinter van for nearly 5 years we thought we'd cracked the code to tiny house on wheels with #vanlife  But, this week we really test ourselves with a brand new setup... a 4X4 truck with a rooftop tent. Not only is it the smallest setup we've ever traveled in but we've also added our 1 year old daughter to the mix. Frankie is such an incredibly adaptable baby but can we really enjoy all that Australia has to offer with a 1 year old child in tow? \n\nWe spot kangaroos, drive a 4X4 rig on some of Australia's most epic beaches and manage to keep up with our mate @MaxandOccy . Make sure you check out his episode for more of our adventures.",

Go to http://DrinkLMNT.com/eamonandbec for a free sample pack with any purchase!\n\nAfter living in a converted sprinter van for nearly 5 years we thought we'd cracked the code to tiny house on wheels with #vanlife  But, this week we really test ourselves with a brand new setup... a 4X4 truck with a rooftop tent. Not only is it the smallest setup we've ever traveled in but we've also added our 1 year old daughter to the mix. Frankie is such an incredibly adaptable baby but can we really enjoy all that Australia has to offer with a 1 year old child in tow? \n\nWe spot kangaroos, drive a 4X4 rig on some of Australia's most epic beaches and manage to keep up with our mate @MaxandOccy . Make sure you check out his episode for more of our adventures."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts"

CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them \"MEmes.\" I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\n\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n\n I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #water  #forge #fire",

Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n\n I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Generation, der sein Leben damit verbracht hat, auf dem Bauernhof seiner Familie zu wachsen, zu arbeiten und zu lernen. Sein Witz und sein trockener Sinn für Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

Son esprit et son sens de l'humour pince-sans-rire plaisent autant aux enfants qu'aux adultes. Produit de la génération du millénaire, son appréciation des nouvelles technologies se mêle à son éthique de travail à l'ancienne, et il offre une capacité unique à transmettre son message d'une manière qui résonne auprès des agriculteurs de longue date ainsi que de ceux qui n'ont aucune connaissance de l'agriculture. Avec la sensibilisation croissante des consommateurs à la provenance de leurs aliments, Zach a identifié le besoin d'une voix indépendante en première ligne de l'agriculture. Zach promeut activement l'agriculture en partageant ses expériences quotidiennes dans le monde agricole tout en fournissant une éducation d'agriculteur à agriculteur pour faciliter une conversation collaborative entre les agriculteurs et le public. \nSuivez-nous \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nÉdité par : Becky Johnson"

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive?\n\nWelcome to THE LONG DARK, the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \"the pinnacle of an entire genre\".\n\nTHE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.\n\nTHE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all!\n\nIn THE LONG DARK, you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE.\n\nIncluded with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK, Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game.\n\nThe game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters.\n\nThe game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive.\n\nMonitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully.\n\nOver 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more.\n\nExplore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle.\n\nHunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates.\n\nFour distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes.\n\nFeatures the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.\n\nSeveral standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each.",

Menunjukkan tantangan untuk tetap hangat, mengangkut air, dan menjaga kapal agar tidak membeku dalam suhu di bawah nol. Kami mengandalkan sumur batu tua untuk air minum, menebang kayu bakar untuk menghangatkan rumah yang ditinggalkan, dan berjuang melawan es, angin, dan isolasi hanya untuk melewati musim ini.\n\nMusim dingin di pulau tanpa jaringan listrik berarti tidak ada yang mudah—semuanya membeku, barang-barang rusak, dan bertahan hidup adalah pekerjaan harian. Kemudian dalam video, kami akhirnya keluar dari pulau dan menuju daratan utama untuk istirahat yang sangat dibutuhkan, mengendarai mobil salju melalui pedalaman Newfoundland bersama teman-teman.\n\nBeginilah kehidupan di pulau tanpa jaringan listrik di musim dingin—dingin, tidak dapat diprediksi, tetapi merupakan petualangan yang luar biasa."

Nous vous montrons les défis de rester au chaud, de transporter de l’eau et d’empêcher les bateaux de geler par des températures négatives. Nous dépendons d’un vieux puits en pierre pour l’eau potable, coupons du bois de chauffage pour chauffer la maison abandonnée et luttons contre la glace, le vent et l’isolement juste pour traverser la saison.\n\nL’hiver sur une île hors réseau signifie que rien n’est facile : tout gèle, les choses se cassent et la survie est un travail quotidien. Plus tard dans la vidéo, nous quittons enfin l’île et nous dirigeons vers le continent pour une pause bien méritée, en parcourant en motoneige l’arrière-pays de Terre-Neuve avec des amis.\n\nVoilà à quoi ressemble la vie insulaire hors réseau en hiver : froide, imprévisible, mais une sacrée aventure."

Ohne Straßen, ohne Strom und durch den Nordatlantik, der uns vom Festland trennt, ist jeder Tag eine neue Herausforderung.\n\nIn diesem Video nehmen wir Sie mit in das abgelegene Winterleben hier im Außenhafen von Neufundland. Wir zeigen Ihnen die Herausforderungen, sich warm zu halten, Wasser zu schleppen und Boote bei Minustemperaturen vor dem Einfrieren zu bewahren. Wir sind auf einen alten Steinbrunnen für Trinkwasser angewiesen, schlagen Brennholz, um das verlassene Haus zu heizen, und kämpfen gegen Eis, Wind und Isolation, nur um die Saison zu überstehen.\n\nIm Winter auf einer Insel ohne Stromnetz ist nichts einfach – alles friert ein, Dinge gehen kaputt und das Überleben ist ein täglicher Kampf. Später im Video verlassen wir endlich die Insel und fahren zum Festland für eine dringend benötigte Pause, bei der wir mit Freunden auf dem Schneemobil durch das Hinterland von Neufundland fahren.\n\nSo sieht das Leben auf einer Insel ohne Stromnetz im Winter aus – kalt, unvorhersehbar, aber ein Wahnsinnsabenteuer."

Sin carreteras ni electricidad y con el Atlántico Norte aislándonos del continente, cada día es un nuevo desafío.\n\nEn este video, te llevamos a lo más profundo de la vida invernal remota aquí en el puerto exterior de Terranova. Mostramos los desafíos de mantenerse caliente, acarrear agua y evitar que los barcos se congelen en temperaturas bajo cero. Dependemos de un antiguo pozo de piedra para beber agua, cortamos leña para calentar la casa abandonada y luchamos contra el hielo, el viento y el aislamiento solo para pasar la temporada.\n\nEl invierno en una isla sin conexión a la red eléctrica significa que nada es fácil: todo se congela, las cosas se rompen y la supervivencia es una tarea diaria. Más adelante en el video, finalmente salimos de la isla y nos dirigimos al continente para un descanso muy necesario, recorriendo en moto de nieve el interior de Terranova con amigos.\n\nAsí es la vida en una isla sin conexión a la red eléctrica en invierno: fría, impredecible, pero una gran aventura."

Mostrando os desafios de se manter aquecido, transportar água e evitar que os barcos congelem em temperaturas abaixo de zero. Dependemos de um velho poço de pedra para beber água, cortamos lenha para aquecer a casa abandonada e lutamos contra o gelo, o vento e o isolamento apenas para passar a estação.\n\nO inverno em uma ilha fora da rede significa que nada é fácil — tudo congela, as coisas quebram e a sobrevivência é uma rotina diária. Mais tarde no vídeo, finalmente saímos da ilha e seguimos para o continente para uma pausa muito necessária, andando de snowmobile pelo interior de Newfoundland com amigos.\n\nÉ assim que a vida em uma ilha fora da rede parece no inverno — fria, imprevisível, mas uma aventura e tanto."

Più avanti nel video, finalmente usciamo dall'isola e ci dirigiamo verso la terraferma per una pausa tanto necessaria, facendo un giro in motoslitta nell'entroterra di Terranova con gli amici.\n\nEcco come si presenta la vita su un'isola fuori dalla rete elettrica in inverno: fredda, imprevedibile, ma un'avventura incredibile."
