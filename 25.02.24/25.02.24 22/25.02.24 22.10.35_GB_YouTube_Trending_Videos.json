            "description": "We'd like to say a huge thank you to the Al Ain Municipality (https://www.instagram.com/alainmun) and Tilal Swaihan (https://www.instagram.com/tilalswaihan) for providing the amazing drag strip, built to the highest standards to ensure safe racing and car proving away from the public roads.\n\nThanks, too, goes to Super Cars Majlis (https://www.instagram.com/supercarsmajlis) for inviting its amazing members along and providing the cars you see in our videos.\n\nAlso, a massive thanks goes to Ryan Griffiths at Syvecs (https://www.instagram.com/ryansyvecs) for his help in organising these races!\n………………………..………………………..………………………..\n\nWe’ve just hit 10 million subscribers on YouTube, and we’re celebrating with the one you’ve all been waiting for… Bugatti vs Koenigsegg Carwow drag race! \n\nMat and the team have flown out to Dubai to get their hands on these awesome hypercars, and they’re about to go head-to-head as they race over the quarter-mile for the chequered flag. But which will come out on top? Let’s take a closer look at the stats. \n\nStarting with the Bugatti, it’s the Chiron Super Sport, which comes with an 8-litre quad-turbo W16 that produces 1600hp and 1600Nm of torque. This power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, and the car weighs 1,995kg. Following several interior & exterior modifications, the car we have here is valued at £5,000,000.\n\nAlongside it, we have the Koenigsegg Jesko Attack. This is powered by a 5-litre twin-turbo V8, and this creates 1280hp and 1000Nm. This power is sent to the rear wheels only via a 9-speed multi-clutch gearbox, and it weighs a whole lot less than the Bugatti, tipping the scales at just 1,420kg! But just like the Chiron Super Sport, it has a price tag of £5,000,000. \n\nSo the Bugatti is well up on power, but it weighs half a tonne more than the Koenigsegg! Could the weight difference prove decisive? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!\n\nMat's sports car choice: https://bit.ly/Mats-Choice-2202\n\nRed Bull F1 Car v McMurtry Spéirling v Rimac Nevera: https://bit.ly/Red-Bull-F1-v-Rimac-v-McMurtry\n\nChange your car with Carwow: https://bit.ly/Change-Your-Car-20-02-25",

                "description": "We'd like to say a huge thank you to the Al Ain Municipality (https://www.instagram.com/alainmun) and Tilal Swaihan (https://www.instagram.com/tilalswaihan) for providing the amazing drag strip, built to the highest standards to ensure safe racing and car proving away from the public roads.\n\nThanks, too, goes to Super Cars Majlis (https://www.instagram.com/supercarsmajlis) for inviting its amazing members along and providing the cars you see in our videos.\n\nAlso, a massive thanks goes to Ryan Griffiths at Syvecs (https://www.instagram.com/ryansyvecs) for his help in organising these races!\n………………………..………………………..………………………..\n\nWe’ve just hit 10 million subscribers on YouTube, and we’re celebrating with the one you’ve all been waiting for… Bugatti vs Koenigsegg Carwow drag race! \n\nMat and the team have flown out to Dubai to get their hands on these awesome hypercars, and they’re about to go head-to-head as they race over the quarter-mile for the chequered flag. But which will come out on top? Let’s take a closer look at the stats. \n\nStarting with the Bugatti, it’s the Chiron Super Sport, which comes with an 8-litre quad-turbo W16 that produces 1600hp and 1600Nm of torque. This power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, and the car weighs 1,995kg. Following several interior & exterior modifications, the car we have here is valued at £5,000,000.\n\nAlongside it, we have the Koenigsegg Jesko Attack. This is powered by a 5-litre twin-turbo V8, and this creates 1280hp and 1000Nm. This power is sent to the rear wheels only via a 9-speed multi-clutch gearbox, and it weighs a whole lot less than the Bugatti, tipping the scales at just 1,420kg! But just like the Chiron Super Sport, it has a price tag of £5,000,000. \n\nSo the Bugatti is well up on power, but it weighs half a tonne more than the Koenigsegg! Could the weight difference prove decisive? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!\n\nMat's sports car choice: https://bit.ly/Mats-Choice-2202\n\nRed Bull F1 Car v McMurtry Spéirling v Rimac Nevera: https://bit.ly/Red-Bull-F1-v-Rimac-v-McMurtry\n\nChange your car with Carwow: https://bit.ly/Change-Your-Car-20-02-25"

            "description": "Thank you to all of you subscribers out there for quite frankly, making all this possible! We can’t wait to make more content for you guys over the coming months (and years) - next up, 2 videos we filmed in Malaysia!! \n\nHELLO FRIENDS and welcome to another video!! This week we are going to be showing you guys the ins ands outs of our entire renovation process for our new studio/office!! We have been haphazardly running around like chickens with our heads cut off for the last (8) years - and so we finally decided it was time to attempt to make our dream studio/office. And because we are huge fans of HGTV-style renovation content, we decided to renovate an old warehouse from top to bottom and document the entire process (also top to bottom).

Wir können es kaum erwarten, in den kommenden Monaten (und Jahren) mehr Inhalte für euch zu erstellen – als Nächstes 2 Videos, die wir in Malaysia gedreht haben!! \n\nHALLO FREUNDE und willkommen zu einem weiteren Video!! Diese Woche zeigen wir euch die Einzelheiten unseres gesamten Renovierungsprozesses für unser neues Studio/Büro!! Wir sind die letzten (8) Jahre planlos wie aufgescheuchte Hühner herumgerannt – und so haben wir endlich beschlossen, dass es an der Zeit ist, zu versuchen, unser Traumstudio/Büro zu bauen. Und weil wir große Fans von Renovierungsinhalten im HGTV-Stil sind, haben wir beschlossen, ein altes Lagerhaus von oben bis unten zu renovieren und den gesamten Prozess (auch von oben bis unten) zu dokumentieren.

            "description": "The Chosen Season 5 in theaters March 28\n---\nI think I'm more excited to deliver this trailer than any we've done. Which isn't a coincidence because I feel the same way about Season Five as a whole. This is our most kick-butt content yet because we cover joy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, excitement, anger, sadness, and fear, sometimes within one episode.\n\nIt’s Holy Week, the most impactful and famous week in human history. Jerusalem is a powder keg with all of Jesus’ followers, enemies, and over a million Passover pilgrims packed into one small place. He shows sides of Himself we’ve never seen till now—turning over tables, literally cracking the whip, and weeping with heartbreak but also love. He also confuses His followers at every turn...and to what end?\n\nThe takeaway for you from this season: Can you believe and follow even when you don't understand?\n\nYes, it’s sad and heartbreaking because we’re getting closer to the cross, but we’re also going to get to see some of the most iconic and deeply moving moments from Scripture. The triumphal entry, the turning of the tables, the betrayal by Judas, and the Last Supper...all set against the biggest backdrop and sets we've ever used with a new widescreen format that demands to be seen on the big screen. But of course, we continue our obsession to humanize and authenticate everyone involved.\n\nThe table is set.

                "description": "The Chosen Season 5 in theaters March 28\n---\nI think I'm more excited to deliver this trailer than any we've done. Which isn't a coincidence because I feel the same way about Season Five as a whole. This is our most kick-butt content yet because we cover joy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, excitement, anger, sadness, and fear, sometimes within one episode.\n\nIt’s Holy Week, the most impactful and famous week in human history. Jerusalem is a powder keg with all of Jesus’ followers, enemies, and over a million Passover pilgrims packed into one small place. He shows sides of Himself we’ve never seen till now—turning over tables, literally cracking the whip, and weeping with heartbreak but also love. He also confuses His followers at every turn...and to what end?\n\nThe takeaway for you from this season: Can you believe and follow even when you don't understand?\n\nYes, it’s sad and heartbreaking because we’re getting closer to the cross, but we’re also going to get to see some of the most iconic and deeply moving moments from Scripture. The triumphal entry, the turning of the tables, the betrayal by Judas, and the Last Supper...all set against the biggest backdrop and sets we've ever used with a new widescreen format that demands to be seen on the big screen. But of course, we continue our obsession to humanize and authenticate everyone involved.\n\nThe table is set. I can't wait for you to see this in theaters.\n\nDallas Jenkins\nCreator, The Chosen\n\n---\nLearn more and get tickets: https://thechosenlastsupper.com/\n\nWatch The Chosen and find exclusive content free and easy on our app: https://www.thechosen.tv/en-us/explore/how-to-watch-the-chosen-season-4-app\n\nWear The Chosen gear and go deeper with our study materials: \nhttps://thechosengifts.com\n\nSupport The Chosen by donating to the Come and See Foundation: https://www.comeandsee.net/donate\n\n#thechosenlastsupper \n\n#BingeJesus by subscribing to our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/thechosenseries?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#GetUsedToDifferent by following us:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsideTheChosen\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thechosentvseries/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thechosentv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thechosentv"

            "description": "Bobby Carter | February 20, 2025\nOn the morning of Leon Thomas' Tiny Desk concert, many NPR staffers assumed the show was postponed due to a snowstorm in the D.C. area. Not only did he proactively schedule his coast-to-coast flight but he was also 30 minutes early to the office. With his sophomore album, MUTT, Thomas has planted his flag as the most exciting artist in R&B music today. The Tiny Desk had to happen now; nothing would get in the way of divine timing.\n\nThomas was destined to be an entertainer — he's been doing it for most of his life. His parents were both musicians and introduced him to their world early on. As an actor, he appeared in multiple Broadway plays before becoming a staple on the Nickelodeon network. Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.\n\nHe opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including \"Breaking Point,\" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: \"This is one of his favorite songs.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"VIBES DON'T LIE\"\n\"YES IT IS\"\n\"MUTT\"\n\"Breaking Point\" \n\"Treasure In The Hills\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeon Thomas: vocals, guitar\nChris Payton: guitar\nAli Roots: keys, piano\nJoe \"Jough\" Cleveland: bass\nQuintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\nTK: background vocals\nAyana Layli: background vocals\nSha'Leah Nikole: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Grace Raver\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #leonthomas",

Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.\n\nHe opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including \"Breaking Point,\" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: \"This is one of his favorite songs.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"VIBES DON'T LIE\"\n\"YES IT IS\"\n\"MUTT\"\n\"Breaking Point\" \n\"Treasure In The Hills\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeon Thomas: vocals, guitar\nChris Payton: guitar\nAli Roots: keys, piano\nJoe \"Jough\" Cleveland: bass\nQuintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\nTK: background vocals\nAyana Layli: background vocals\nSha'Leah Nikole: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Grace Raver\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #leonthomas"

Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support!

One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

Use code BLACKTAIL at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/blacktail\n\nUPDATE: I now have evidence that the scammer I have been talking to is the same person(s) that scammed Teresa in this video. After giving her the table she posted the three of us with the table on Facebook. Shortly after, my scammer sent me her Facebook photo and said that was the table he built for me. So there would only be one reason a random scammer would follow a random lady in Iowa. Anyway, get out there and waste their time! \n\n\nWARNING: if you engage with any scammers make sure you take steps to protect yourself and your identity.

Use code BLACKTAIL at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/blacktail\n\nUPDATE: I now have evidence that the scammer I have been talking to is the same person(s) that scammed Teresa in this video. After giving her the table she posted the three of us with the table on Facebook. Shortly after, my scammer sent me her Facebook photo and said that was the table he built for me. So there would only be one reason a random scammer would follow a random lady in Iowa. Anyway, get out there and waste their time! \n\n\nWARNING: if you engage with any scammers make sure you take steps to protect yourself and your identity.

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!\n—\n\n🎬 *CREDITS:*\nDIRECTOR/HOST » Sonny Side\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Trần Quang Đạo\nCAMERA OPERATOR » Đinh Tuấn Anh\nEPISODE EDITOR » Ngọc Lê Hồng\nCOLOR & MASTER » Quí Nguyễn\nON-GROUND PRODUCER » Terryh Nguyen\nCO-PRODUCER » Chantal Bieger\nCO-HOSTS » DaHong 大红 https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5e7fc5c600000000010034d6 | Bert https://www.instagram.com/foodxbert\n\nSelected tracks via Audio Network 🛆\n\n*Business Inquiries:*\n✉️ marketing@befrs.com"

            "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test!

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",
